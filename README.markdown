# Building local

## Setup

You need ```hyde``` to generate the html files. We need also Python Pillow to create thumbnails.   
 
You can install both with ```pip```
```bash
sudo pip install hyde
sudo pip install Pillow
```

## Building

```
hyde gen
```

or

```
hyde gen -r
```

to generate all files. Alternatively you can use make, which calls hyde
gen, but takes care of the dependencies unknown to hyde:

```
make
```

You'll find the generated homepage in the ```deploy/``` directory. Use

```
hyde serve
```

to open a local web server for a preview ( http://localhost:8080 ).


# Server setup

To deliver the OVH newsfeed we have to download it periodically. For this task you could use the following cron entry in the ```/etc/crontab```

```
23 5    * * *   www-data    /usr/bin/wget -q -O /var/www/sponsors/sponsor-ovh-news.inc.html feedUrl
```
