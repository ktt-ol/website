# Building local

## Setup

You need ```hyde``` to generate the html files. We need also Python Pillow to create thumbnails.   
 
You can install both with ```pip2```
```bash
sudo pip2 install hyde
sudo pip2 install Pillow
sudo pip2 install Image
```

## Building

```
hyde gen
```

or

```
hyde gen -r
```

to generate all files. Alternatively you can use make, which calls hyde
gen, but takes care of the dependencies unknown to hyde:

```
make
```

You'll find the generated homepage in the ```deploy/``` directory. Use

```
hyde serve
```

to open a local web server for a preview ( http://localhost:8080 ).
