While the status-switch is nice, it does not help to actually
get into a hackspace. For this you need some keys and with
multiple people having access rights having a single key
is quite annoying. While there are a few simple solutions
they usually lack some desired features. Thus we decided to
implement a digital access control system, that can open
our doors.

## Hardware

As visible in the <a href="//map.mainframe.io">space map</a>, there are multiple
ways to get into our Hackspace. Let's have a look at the main entrance for now.
The first door is the building's entrance downstairs. This is not yet handled
by the access control system, since its not exclusively used by us and needs
agreements with different people first.

Then in the second floor (not counting the ground level - the building has no
first floor) there is a glass-door from the staircase to our front corridor.
This door has been armed with a few sensors by us, a door opener as well as a
bell button next to it. The corridor is also used as emergency exit from our
neighbours, so the glass-door contains a panic lock. It will automatically
unlock the door if somebody uses the inner doorhandle. We notice any door
opening by the door using a small reed-contact and always know if the door is
locked using a bolt-switch. This information is fed into our <a
href="//grafana.mainframe.io">Grafana</a> instance. If the door is not locked,
it can be opened using a door opener (buzzer). Our access control system opens
the door, if the bell button is pressed and the space is not closed. If it is
closed, the bell button rings the bell instead. A small ws2812b LED inside of
the bell button gives a hint about the current space status.

Next, there are two doors going from the corridor onto our main area. One going
straight to the main area (AKA main-door) and one going via our conference
room. The one going via the conference room is not yet upgraded, but the main-door
has the same sensors as the glass-door, as well as the door opener and the bell
button. Additionally it already had a keypad, which has been integrated into our
access control system. This door also has a motor-lock (using an ABUS CFA1000).

Historically we used the status-switch, to change the space-status and a normal
key to (un)lock the door. We are currently migrating away from the switch to a
SSH based setup (and an Android app using our custom ssh interface) for changing
the space-status. Then the door-lock will automatically (un)lock the space based
upon the status provided via ssh. Once unlocked the door can be opened by our
members using the keypad. Guests can ring the bell using the bell button instead.
There is also an "Open House" mode, which is called "open+" by us. In this mode
the bell button directly opens the door.

Below you can see a diagram of all hardware implementing the above. The green
boxes are related to the glass-door and the blue boxes to the main-door. The
orange boxes relate to hardware on our main area. The red dashed line is a
ws2812b bus provided by an attiny85 and provides status indications. The green
dashed lines are GPIO handles. Note that those are slightly simplified, as
they sometimes contain pull-ups/pull-downs, logic-level converters or even
relays to control the actual hardware.

## Sofware

The handling of the GPIOs and other hardware components happens on a Raspberry
Pi 2 running a (minimal) Debian and Debian kernel. The <a
href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_tree">device tree</a> has been modificated
slightly, so that the kernel knows about the mcp23017 port expanders and the
keypad.

Since there is no userspace support for DT overlays in the mainline/Debian
kernel so far; the standard DT blob must be modified instead. The one provided
by Debian's kernel package can be made readable again using `dtc -I dtb -O dts
-o rpi.dts /path/to/rpi.dtb`.  Then we add our custom modifications from <a
href="{{ content_url("project/acs/devicetree-additions.dts")
}}">devicetree-additions.dts</a>.

With that done the software from the github repository linked above can be used.
It comes with multiple daemons:

## SSH Setup

On the RPi a new system user is created e.g. "keyholder". For this user
the login shell is set to "acs-keyholder-interface", which runs with
suid bit. It only supports a few commands (actually just "set-status"
and "set-next-status" at the moment). Apart from that you provide a
~/.ssh/authorized_keys in the usual format. Last but not least the user
information must be added to the user DB (usually `/var/lib/acs.db`).

If you now try to set the state using `ssh keyholder@access-control-system
set-status open+ "Open 4 all!"` the system will check the fingerprint of the
key, that did the ssh login and infer the user information from that generating
a few simple files in `/run/acs-state`. These files are interpreted by
acs-mqtt-fwd and acs-doorctrl respectively.

If the deprecated status switch is used to change the status, the files in
/run/acs-state are deleted.
